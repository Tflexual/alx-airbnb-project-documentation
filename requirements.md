Airbnb Clone – Backend Requirements Specification
1. Introduction

This document provides detailed technical and functional specifications for the Airbnb Clone backend system.
It covers three key features:

User Authentication

Property Management

Booking System

The goal is to define the behavior, input/output specifications, and API endpoints for the development phase.

2. Feature 1: User Authentication
2.1 Functional Description

This feature enables users to register, log in, and manage their account securely.
It includes user creation, authentication, and token-based authorization.

2.2 API Endpoints

  },
  "token": "eyJhbGciOi..."
}

2.5 Validation Rules

3. Feature 2: Property Management
3.1 Functional Description

Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings.
Users can browse and search available properties.

3.2 API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/v1/properties	Create a new property listing
GET	/api/v1/properties	Get all properties
GET	/api/v1/properties/:id	Get property details
PUT	/api/v1/properties/:id	Update property information
DELETE	/api/v1/properties/:id	Remove a property listing
3.3 Input Specification

Create Property Example:

{
  "title": "Luxury Apartment in Lagos",
  "location": "Lekki, Lagos",
  "price_per_night": 25000,
  "description": "Modern apartment with sea view.",
  "amenities": ["WiFi", "Air Conditioning", "Pool"]
}

3.4 Output Specification

Success Response:

{
  "message": "Property created successfully",
  "property": {
    "id": "p123",
    "title": "Luxury Apartment in Lagos",
    "price_per_night": 25000
  }
}

3.5 Validation Rules

Title: Required, max 100 characters

Price per night: Must be > 0

Location: Required

Amenities: Optional array of strings

3.6 Performance Criteria

Must return search results in under 1 second.

Should support up to 10,000 property records efficiently.

4. Feature 3: Booking System
4.1 Functional Description

Allows users to book available properties, view booking history, and cancel bookings.

4.2 API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/api/v1/bookings	Create a new booking
GET	/api/v1/bookings	Get all bookings for the logged-in user
GET	/api/v1/bookings/:id	Retrieve details of a specific booking
DELETE	/api/v1/bookings/:id	Cancel a booking
4.3 Input Specification

Create Booking Example:

{
  "property_id": "p123",
  "check_in": "2025-11-10",
  "check_out": "2025-11-15"
}

4.4 Output Specification

Success Response:

{
  "message": "Booking confirmed",
  "booking": {
    "id": "b456",
    "property_id": "p123",

4.5 Validation Rules

Check-in date must be before check-out date

Property must be available for the selected period

Only authenticated users can create bookings

4.6 Performance Criteria

Booking confirmation in < 700ms

Prevents overlapping bookings for the same property

5. Security Considerations

All API routes except /auth/register and /auth/login require JWT authentication.

Passwords must be hashed using bcrypt.

Sensitive data like tokens should never be logged.

6. Error Handling Examples

Example Response:

{
  "error": "Invalid credentials",
  "status_code": 401
}

7. Conclusion

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for developers implementing the backend of the Airbnb Clone project.
It defines how data is validated, processed, and exchanged through secure API endpoints.
